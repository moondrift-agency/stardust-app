# GROUPOMANIA

"Groupomania" is the seventh project I worked on during my training with OpenClassrooms. In this scenario, I had to set up an internal social network. The aim of this tool was to facilitate interactions between colleagues in the fictitious company Groupomania.

I had to create both the backend and the frontend with the technology of my choice. There was no specification for the graphic charter, nor any mock-up provided.

Stack utilisées :
- **Backend** : Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize
- **Frontend** : React, Redux, Bootstrap
